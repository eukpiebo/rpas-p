Most industrial plants use ducts to transport hazardous gasses between process units.
Expansion joints are critical elements of a flue gas duct system.
Expansion joints typically fail due to internal chemical attack or mechanical degradation from the process stream.

Obstructions from process deposits inside a duct or breaches to atmosphere from a duct can present significant process, health, safety and environmental risks.

External visual inspections of ducting systems are reactionary in that they detect such defects after a breach.

Internal visual inspection programs can be used as a preemptive asset integrity management tool by measuring progressive degradation of the duct or expansion joint at critical points inside the duct system.

However, process ducts are typically not designed to enable effective visual inspection of its internals along its entire length.

Typical ducting systems are lightweight construction not designed to support the weight of an inspector.
The obvious confined space hazards also prevent effective internal inspection.

ATMECO Fluid Motion can provide qualitative and quantitative flue duct condition information and eliminate confined space risks through our remote operated vehicle (ROV) survey services.

Our ROV-360 duct inspection service was specifically developed to meet the requirements of a refinery flue duct condition based monitoring (CBM) program. 

This is an example of how we design, build and deploy unique technology based services to solve asset integrity survey challenges

The ATMECO Fluid Motion remote operated ROV-360 inspection service offers a range of unique capabilities;<br>
•	Secure fiber optic command and control link between the operator / inspector and the ROV.<br>
•	On-board distance measurement to accurately locate points of interest inside the duct.<br>
•	Artificial horizon and all terrain capability to navigate obstructions inside the duct.<br>
•	Non sparking (brushless propulsion) with on-board LEL monitoring and live visual and audio feedback to the ROV operator & asset inspector.<br>
•	Remote controlled 360 Degree gimbal with high-resolution point of view inspection camera.<br>
•	Gyroscopic stabilized imaging system to generate 8K resolution 360 Degree stereoscopic or 360 degree 3-D video of the flue duct internals.<br>
•	360 degree 3-D reality models enabling measurements of flue duct critical inspection points.<br>
•	Bi-directional high bandwidth Ethernet & RS-232 communications links proving flexibility to integrate a range of inspection sensors including;<br>
o	Radiometric Infra-red imaging systems<br>
o	Medium Wave infrared Optical Gas Imaging Systems<br>
o	Laser absorption spectroscopy Methane leak detection and quantification systems<br>
o	3-D imaging systems to generate photogrammetry or laser based reality models.<br>

Our RPAS website contains video examples of the ROV-360 service.
