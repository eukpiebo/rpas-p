ATMECO Fluid Motion delivers qualitative and quantitative asset condition information from hazardous area surveys.

We deploy innovative technologies to deliver asset integrity information safely and cost effectively.

An ATMECO Fluid Motion ROV-360 survey provides an interactive 360-degree monoscopic or stereoscopic 3-D view of your confined space assets.

Our ROV operators / inspectors monitor live streamed 2-D & 3-D video enabling inspection in any direction along the entire survey path.
System control is via a high bandwidth fibre optic Ethernet communications link between the ROV operator / inspectors and on-board sensors.

For typical confined space surveys we deploy conventional single lens digital cameras and 360-degree 3-D high resolution video cameras. 

Points of interest along the entire survey path are catalogued via on-board distance measurement and display.

Deployment is done under typical hot work permit conditions. On-board gas detection is monitored visually and audibly from the ROV control station.

On-board low voltage LED lighting provides variable levels of illumination in all directions for surveying dark confined spaces

Articulated suspension, remote differential lock and an all-wheel-drive system enable the survey platform to traverse up to 45 degree inclines and over obstacles along the survey path.

Additional sensors can be integrated to capture a range of qualitative or quantitative data. (Point Cloud Laser Scanners for accurate x-y-z dimensions, gimballed line of sight Laser Absorption Spectroscopy Scanners for Methane gas detection and quantification, Robotic arms with conventional NDT sensors, etc..)

Post survey 2-D & 3-D video reports enable inspectors (using conventional high-resolution monitors or virtual reality goggles) to re-survey the entire route and inspect asset attributes not viewed during the initial survey.

Our interactive 3-D video survey reports provide an immersive experience. This adds context when assessing asset condition information located inside a confined space.

Our RPAS website contains video examples of the ROV-360 service.

Please contact us to discuss how we can assist with your hazardous area flue duct and expansion joint internal condition-monitoring program to prevent breaches to atmosphere.
