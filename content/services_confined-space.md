Large storage tanks, pipe racks, boilers and reformers are examples of assets involving restricted or confined inspection activity.

ATMECO Fluid Motion remote piloted asset survey services can reduce or eliminate risks by minimizing confined space man-hours.

Our restricted and confined space survey capability includes remote piloted aerial survey (RPAS) and remote operated vehicle (ROV) survey services.

Our RPAS services deliver qualitative and quantitative condition based monitoring data.

Examples of restricted and confined space applications where our RPAS and ROV survey services have been deployed include:
•	Steam / Methane reformer internal wall and roof refractory tile and burner nozzle integrity survey - RPAS
•	Compressor building internal roof truss / beam joint integrity survey - RPAS
•	Flue gas duct internal refractory and expansion joint integrity survey - ROV
•	Flue gas stack internal refractory lining integrity survey – RPAS

Visual inspection programs using RPAS & ROV systems can be used as a pre-emptive asset integrity management tool by measuring progressive condition degradation at critical inspection points inside an asset.

For RPAS or ROV derived data to be of value to a condition based monitoring program, the data capture process requires accuracy, clarity and repeatability.

Our RPAS technology and survey procedures enable accurate and stable positioning of the survey sensors to capture clear, unobstructed imagery of the point of interest. 
We are able to re-position our RPAS & ROV sensor platforms to the same location repeatedly to enable repeatable base-line deviation measurement over time.

ATMECO Fluid Motion design, build and deploy RPAS and ROV technology to solve client asset integrity survey challenges.

Our ROV-360 duct inspection system was specifically developed to meet the requirements of a refinery flue duct condition based monitoring (CBM) program.

We have a comprehensive fleet of commercial and custom built RPAS platforms and sensor options.
Survey scope of work and data deliverables will determine which platform and sensor combinations we deploy.
